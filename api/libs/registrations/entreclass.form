# Entrepreneurial Class Registration: Vobyus and Deftsign

## Hello Everyone!

Thank you for your continued support. We really enjoy supporting Deftsign and Vobyus. As we discussed earlier,
I would like to increase the number of times we meet in order
to better empower the students for next school year's competitions. 

## Schedule

Next session will start sometime during the week of **4/19** based
on the feedback concerning what times work best for everyone. 
The session will end 14 weeks later sometime in the week of **7/19**. If during the summer
we are able to meet again in person at the studio. we can revisit the schedule.

project. The coach will focus on teaching the students new things as needed.
